Hello, my name is Kristy Delacruz and I am a computer science major.
I love to ride my bike around the city and travel around the world. Ive been to South America, Europe and Central America. I also enjoy reading books on my free time. Anything from romance to non-fiction.
Some of my career interests fall under software/web development.
